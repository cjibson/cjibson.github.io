                <img src="images\rbs\breece_hall.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Breece Hall takes the top spot of my running back rankings. Coming off a torn ACL, Hall exceeded expectation in 2023 finishing as the RB 4.
                    With an upgraded offensive line and another year of recovery, I expect him to have an even better 2024 and beyond.

                <img src="images\rbs\jahmyr_gibbs.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Jahmyr Gibbs may be the most explosive running back in the NFL. Gibbs had an excellent rookie year in 2023, and has the benefit of running 
                    behind one of the best lines in the league. The only reason he isn't my top RB is due to the fact the Lions tend to split the carries between 
                    two back, meaning his upside is capped.

                <img src="images\rbs\bijan_robinson.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Although Bijan Robinson had a solid rookie season, most fantasy managers were left somewhat disappointed due to the draft capital and hype 
                    surrounding him as a prospect. I expect him to be better in the upcoming seasons now that former head coach Arthur Smith is out of town.

                <img src="images\rbs\christian_mccaffrey.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Christian McCaffrey is coming off one of the most dominant fantasy football years ever by a running back. That being said, I don't have 
                    him ranked any higher due to injury concerns. Most RBs have their production fall off a cliff when they hit 28, which is the age CMC 
                    will be this upcoming season. Still, he is too talented to rank any lower.

                <img src="images\rbs\saquon_barkley.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Similarily too McCaffrey, I have age concerns around Saquon Barkley. That being said, moving on from the Giants to the Eagles will be a 
                    much needed change in scenery for the running back. He should have a great 2024 season, but Dynasty managers should be weary of the seasons beyond.

                <img src="images\rbs\travis_etienne.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Travis Etienne had a solid 2023 campaign, in which the running back finished 3rd overall. That being said, many of his points came on touchdowns, a number
                    which I expect to regress a bit. Still, the young RB is explosive and has the job locked down.

                <img src="images\rbs\devon_achane.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>When healthy, there is no other running back in the league that can take any touch to the house like De'von Achane. The key for Achane will be to 
                    remain health. In his rookie season, he only played in about half the games. However, he is just too explosive and talented to be ranked any lower.

                <img src="images\rbs\isiah_pacheco.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Isiah Pacheco took over the starting running back job for the Chiefs in 2023 and delivered a solid campaign. I expect the former 7th-round pick to 
                    continue to be a solid contributor on the Chiefs. The only reason I don't have him ranked higher is because the Chiefs often run trick plays around 
                    the goal-line, which caps Pacheco's upside.

                <img src="images\rbs\james_cook.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>James Cook had solid sophmore season in 2023 where he took over the lead role in Buffalo. Although he is more explosive and has better receiving upside
                    than several players above him, fumbles were an issue. Additionally, his upside is capped due to QB Josh Allen's rushing dominance in the redzone.

                <img src="images\rbs\kenneth_walker.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>I love the way Kenneth Walker runs the ball, he is extremely explosive and hits the hole with anger. The problem is this often leads to injury and he 
                    is guaranteed to miss a few games every year. I also think second year back Zach Charbonnet will continue to eat into Walker's work load, capping his 
                    upside.

                <img src="images\rbs\rachaad_white.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Rachaad White is a very hard player for me to rank. He had a great 2023, but most of his production is due to sheer volume. He does everything well,
                    but he lacks the explosiveness to catapult him into the upper echelon of RBs. I can see a world in which the Buccaneers move on from him after 2024
                    and he fails to find a role with a new team where he receives the same volume.

                <img src="images\rbs\kyren_williams.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Kyren Williams is in a similar boat as Rachaad White. He had incredible volume last year with the Rams, but he lacks big play ability and has had
                    injury problems in his first two years. Head coach Sean McVay is also known to shop around, and there is a very real scenario where the Rams move
                    on and Kyren isn't able to find another starting job.
