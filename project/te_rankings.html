                <img src="images\tes\sam_laporta.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>The top spot of my tight end rankings goes to the tight end 1 and rookie phenom from last year, Sam LaPorta. LaPorta is a true tight end in
                    the sense that he can block and catch, meaning he is always on the field. Tight ends typically take a few years to develop, so the fact he
                    played this well as a rookie means the sky is the limit.

                <h2>2. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361307/trey-mcbride">Trey McBride</a></h2>
                <img src="images\tes\trey_mcbride.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>After taking the starting spot from Zach Ertz half way through the season, Trey McBride broke out as the Cardinals top receiving option in
                    his second season. He is everything you want in a TE; he's athletic, has great hands, good size, and can block. With the Cardinals poised to
                    take a receiver at the top of the draft, defenses won't be able to double McBride anymore either.

                <img src="images\tes\dalton_kincaid.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Dalton Kincaid had about as good of a rookie year as you can ask for. He was a target magnet and Josh Allen looked his way often on 3rd downs.
                    With the Bills trading their top receiver in Stefon Diggs away, it shows their confidence in Kincaid going forward. The former Utah TE should
                    only improve from here.

                <img src="images\tes\mark_andrews.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Unfortunately, most of Mark Andrews' 2023 season was lost due to a nasty ankle injury. Still, when he was healthy he proved to be the most 
                    dominant redzone target in the league. Tight Ends tend to hang around in the league longer than other positions, so the fact that he is 28
                    years old isn't a concern at this point.

                <img src="images\tes\kyle_pitts.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Kyle Pitts is probably the hardest player to rank on this list. He had an incredible rookie season, but the last 2 that followed weren't 
                    anything memorable. He hasn't had good coaching or QB play over the last 2 years, but that is set to change. All eyes are on him with the 
                    arrival of offensive coordinator Zac Robinson and quarterback Kirk Cousins.

                <img src="images\tes\tj_hockenson.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>TJ Hockenson has slowly improved every year since being taken in the 1st round of the 2019 draft. 2023 was a great season for him that 
                    ultimately ended with a torn ACL. Hopefully he can bounce back in 2025, but that is a long time for fantasy managers to wait. If it 
                    weren't for the injury, he'd be much higher on my list.

                <img src="images\tes\george_kittle.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>George Kittle is probably the best overall tight end in the league. He is absolutely electric with the ball in his hands, and it often
                    take multiple people to take him down. He is also the best blocking tight end in the league. Unfortunately, this leads to him blocking
                    more often than receiving, which caps his upside.

                <img src="images\tes\travis_kelce.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>It seems that Travis Kelce is finally starting to decline, which is understandable considering he will be playing the upcoming season
                    at 35 years old. He should still have a couple good years in him considering he doesn't rely as much on athleticism as other players,
                    but managers should be preparing to find a replacement.

                <img src="images\tes\cole_kmet.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Cole Kmet is an outstanding tight end that has one of the biggest frames and softest hands at the position. This leads to him being an
                    incredible redzone threat. I think his production might take a hit this year though due to the Bears bringing in WR Keenan Allen and RB
                    De'andre Swift, who will take receptions and redzone opportunities from him.

                <img src="images\tes\david_njoku.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>David Njoku had a solid run to end the 2023 season that saw him breakout as one of the Browns top receiving threats. Ultimately, it's 
                    hard to determine if that was due to Njoku dominating, or playing with backup QB Joe Flacco who is known to hyper-target tight ends.
                    Still, the extremely athletic Njoku has great upside.
                </p>

                <img src="images\tes\evan_engram.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Leading all tight ends in receptions, Evan Engram had a great year in 2023. Often a security blanket for QB Trevor Lawrence, many of
                    his target came close to the line of scrimmage. This puts a cap on his upside, but the target volume means he should still be a safe option.

                <img src="images\tes\dalton_schultz.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Dalton Schultz signed a new deal with the Texans tying him to CJ Stroud for the foreseeable future. Schultz is a very underrated tight end,
                    and he has the potential to put up some solid numbers with the Texans. Ultimately, it will depend on the pecking order, as there are a lot
                    of mouths to feed on the Texans.
