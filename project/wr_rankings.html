                <img src="images\wrs\ceedee_lamb.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>The top spot of my wide receiver rankings goes to CeeDee Lamb. Lamb had an incredible 2023 season in which he finished as the WR 1. He has also
                    improved every year so far in his career, and I can only see him continuing to dominate.

                <img src="images\wrs\jamarr_chase.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Ja'Marr Chases production took a slight dip in 2023, mostly due to QB Joe Burrow spending most of the season injured. Chase has proved time 
                    and time again that he may have the highest ceiling of any WR in the league. Still only 23 years old, Chase has the potential to be one of
                    the greatest wide receivers of all time.

                <img src="images\wrs\justin_jefferson.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>The 3rd spot in my wide receiver rankings goes to Ja'Marr Chase's former teammate, Justin Jefferson. Jefferson had a disappointing 2023 
                    campaign after missing half the season with a hamstring injury. From a pure talent perspective, he is the best wide receiver in the league
                    in my opinion. The only reason I don't have him higher is due to the uncertainty surrounding the QB position in Minnesota.

                <img src="images\wrs\amonra_stbrown.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>After solid rookie and sophmore seasons, Amon-Ra St. Brown broke out in year 3 finishing 2nd in receptions and 3rd in receiving yards. He 
                    is the focal point of the Lions offense and is always open when a play needs to be made. His biggest selling point is his consistency, and
                    I believe he will continue to produce at a high level for years to come.

                <img src="images\wrs\tyreek_hill.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Tyreek Hill was on a historical pace in 2023 before hurting his ankle late in the season. Had he not been injured, I truly believe he would've
                    been the first receiver to break the 2,000 yard threshold. Although he has shown no signs of slowing down, he is approaching 30, a known age-cliff
                    for wide receivers.

                <img src="images\wrs\puka_nacua.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Puka Nacua may be my favorite wide receiver to watch in the league. In 2023, the former BYU receiver broke Bill Groman's record for 
                    receiving yards by a rookie, a record which had stood since 1960. The 22 year old still has room to improve, and I would have him higher on 
                    my list if there was more certainty surrounding the Rams QB situation in the coming years.

                <img src="images\wrs\garrett_wilson.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Garrett Wilson is one of the most exciting young receivers in the league. After two solid seasons receiving passes from a revolving room of
                    quarterbacks, Wilson would benefit from some continuity. Hopefully the revamped Jets offense with Aaron Rodgers at the helm can unlock his
                    full potential.

                <img src="images\wrs\dj_moore.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>After a career year, DJ Moore will have a new QB throwing passes to him in 2024 and beyond. Caleb Williams is all but a lock to go 1st overall
                    in the upcoming draft, and should be an upgrade from Justin Fields. Still only 26 years old, DJ Moore appears to be entering his prime and 
                    should be a top 10 WR over the next few years.

                <img src="images\wrs\rashee_rice.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>The Chiefs have been searching for a wide receiver since trading Tyreek Hill away a few years ago. After multiple draft busts, it seems they
                    have finally found what they were looking for in Rashee Rice. Rice finished 2nd in receiving yards for rookies in 2023, only behind Nacua's 
                    record year. His route running still has a ton of room for improvement, so his potential is one of the highest in the NFL.

                <img src="images\wrs\nico_collins.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Nico Collins is such a hard player to rank. After 2 forgettable years in Houston, Nico broke out in year 3 with the arrival of C.J. Stroud.
                    Although both him and fellow Texans wide receiver Tank Dell had solid seasons, I have some concerns due to the fact that the Texans traded
                    for star receiver Stefon Diggs. Going into a contract year, if the Texans decide to extend Nico tying him to Stroud he would jump up to 7th
                    in my rankings.

                <img src="images\wrs\jaylen_waddle.jpg" alt="Player Image">
                <p>Jaylen Waddle benefits from playing on one of the pass-happiest offenses in the league. Due to this, the Dolphins are able to have 2 wide
                    receivers capable of finishing in the top 10. Waddle has been solid every year he has been in the league, and as long as he stays healthy,
                    I don't see that changing.

                <p>Rounding out my top 12 wide receivers for Dynasty leagues is Zay Flowers. Zay showed the most promise from a Ravens receiver in a long 
                    time. He is Lamar Jackson's favorite target and it was obvious that they want to get him the ball often. I expect him to continue to grow,
                    and he has the explosiveness to become a Tyreek Hill-esque receiver.
